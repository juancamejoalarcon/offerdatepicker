This is a datepicker calendar that lets you select a range of dates and within that range you are also able to select days when you don't want this range to be applied. For instance, if I were to create an offer, that is going to be available during a period of time, but I don't want this offer to be available on Saturdays, or the day 24th of December, this datepicker lets you select both, so within a range you will also have 'blackouts' (didn't know how to call it).

## Quick tutorial

<ol>
    <li>Select the range</li>
    <li>Press the 'blackouts' button</li>
    <li>Select your blackouts</li>
    <li>If you want to unselect a blackout just press it again</li>
    <li>If you want to unselect all the blackouts press the 'clear' button</li>
</ol>
