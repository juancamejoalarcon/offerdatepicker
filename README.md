# Offerdatepicker

This is a datepicker calendar that lets you select a range of dates and within that range you are also able to select days when you don't want this range to be applied. For instance, if I were to create an offer, that is going to be available during a period of time, but I don't one this offer to be available on Saturdays, or the day 24th of December, this datepicker let you select both, so within a range you will also have 'blackouts' (didn't know how to call it).

## Quick tutorial

1. Select the range
2. Press the button
